Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and prints whether it is even or odd.
Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, reverse it, and print the reversed list.
Write a program to replace all occurrences of "hello" with "hi" in the string "hello world, hello Python".

-- Medium

Create a dictionary where the keys are strings "a", "b", "c" and the values are lists of numbers. Print the second element from the list of key "a".
Write a program to count how many times the number 5 appears in the tuple (1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4).
Given a list of integers, remove duplicates using a set, then convert it back into a sorted list.

-- Hard

Take a string input from the user. Count how many vowels are in the string, and store the counts in a dictionary (e.g., {'a': 2, 'e': 1}).
Write a program that takes a nested list (matrix) and prints the transpose. Example: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] â†’ [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]].
Given two lists of numbers, return a set containing numbers that are in first list but not in second, and another set containing numbers that are common in both.
