'''1. Write a function that returns the factorial of a number using both recursion and iteration.
2. Given a list of integers, return a dictionary with the number as the key and its frequency as the value.
3. Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
4. Write a program to find the second largest number in a list without using built-in functions like `sorted()`.
5. Given a string, return the first non-repeating character.
6. Write a function that flattens a nested list. Example: `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5] → [1,2,3,4,5]`.
7. Implement a function that checks if a number is prime.
8. Write a function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common element.
9. Given a list of numbers, return a list of cumulative sums. Example: `[1,2,3] → [1,3,6]`.
10. Implement a program to rotate a list by `k` positions. Example: `[1,2,3,4,5]` rotated by `2` → `[4,5,1,2,3]`.
11. Write a function that removes all duplicates from a list **in place** (without creating a new list).
12. Implement a function to check if a string has balanced parentheses.
13. Write a function that merges two dictionaries. If the same key exists, sum their values.
14. Given a list of tuples `(name, score)`, write a program to sort it by score in descending order.
15. Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
16. Implement a program to find the longest word in a sentence.
17. Write a function to reverse the words in a string without using `split()`. Example: `"Hello World"` → `"World Hello"`.
18. Implement a function that takes a list and returns a new list with only the unique elements (preserving order).
19. Write a function that finds all pairs of numbers in a list that add up to a target sum.
20. Create a decorator that logs the arguments and result of a function.'''
