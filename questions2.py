⚡ Easy (warm-up)

1 - Take a number input and print its binary form (bin()) and whether it is divisible by 3.
2 - Given the string "Python\nRocks\tHard", print its length and also print it again without escape characters being interpreted (raw string).
3- Create a tuple of numbers, unpack it into variables, and reverse those variables into a new tuple.

⚡ Medium (logic twist)

4 - Write a program that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where the keys are the numbers and the values are whether they are "even" or "odd".
5 - Given a sentence string, count the frequency of each word and store it in a dictionary. Ignore case.
6 - Create two sets from lists of numbers. Print:
      Elements only in the first set,
      Elements only in the second set,
      Elements common in both,
      Union of both (no duplicates).

⚡ Hard (real interview vibes)

7 - Take a list of integers and return a new list with duplicates removed but keep the original order (hint: don’t just use set() blindly).
8 - Given a matrix (list of lists), write code to:
      Find the sum of each row,
      Find the sum of each column.
9 - You’re given a dictionary: Flatten all the values into a single sorted list without duplicates.
    data = {"a": [1,2,3], "b": [4,5], "c": [6,7,8,9]}
